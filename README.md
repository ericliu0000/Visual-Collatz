# Visual-Collatz
 
Graphing program to show the progression of numbers in the Collatz Conjecture

Written using JavaFX


To run:

mvn clean

mvn javafx:run


You need a version of Java and Maven to run this, I don't know which one of Java but I'm using 11 so that one works. I also set some stuff in the pom that says 11 so I think it is the best.
